Changes to nucleic-1.1.top to convert it into nucleic-3.0.top.  Guillermo A. Bermejo.

DONE:

Changed atom types.

Charges unchanged.

BOND, DONO, ACCE, and IC statements unchanged. 

Replaced DIHE and IMPR statements by those in CNS.

Swapped the following names in the added DIHE and IMPR statements:

	H2' <-> H2''
GUA:	H21 <-> H22
ADE:	H61 <-> H62
CYT:	H41 <-> H42


TO DO:

Delete "DELEte BOND ... ADD BOND" statements in PRESidue DEOX.

Delete IC statements, including PRESidue 2END.

Highlight (with comments) non-IUPAC names:

	H2''	should be	H2'
	H2'			HO2' (RNA)
	H2'			H2'' (DNA)
	O2P			O1P and vice versa (check!)
THY:	C5A			C7
THY:	H5#			H7#		


Type XBR, defined via MASS, is actually not used.

Comment DIHE statements in TED residue? (Note that all other dihedrals in the file are commented.)
