<h1 style="text-align: center;">HOWTO: Create sampled rotamer libraries</h1>
This document details how to use the Richardson lab rotamer data to
create a sampled library of rotamers, <span style="font-style: italic;">e.g.</span>
for protein design calculations.<br>
<br>
There is already a target in the <span style="font-family: monospace;">Makefile</span>,
called <span style="font-family: monospace;">rotasamp</span>, for
constructing sampled rotamer libraries. You can start with this target
and further modify it to meet your needs. (Found at about line 290 as
of August 2004.) Unless you've run <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">make clean</span> or otherwise
corrupted the original distribution, you shouldn't have to run any
other targets (<span style="font-style: italic;">e.g.</span> <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">make rota</span>) first.<br>
<br>
The calculation proceeds in two steps. In the first step, a <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">.list</span> file is generated.
Samples can be found in the <span style="font-family: monospace;">rotasamp/</span>
folder. Each line corresponds to one sample point, and lists all the
chi angles for that sidechain. The final two numbers, cryptically
labeled "main" and "check", are for debugging and calculating a
weighting factor or figure of merit for each rotamer. If you're
generating your own list files, you can set them to 1.0 and ignore
them. In the second step, the list file is transformed into a PDB file.
One residue entry is created for each line in the list file, with its
chi angles twisted to the values specified in the list.<br>
<br>
By creating your own list files, you can transform any collection of
chi angle specifications into PDB-format conformers for use in your
application. This is accomplished with the (included) Java program <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">chiropraxis.sc.RotamerSampler</span>,
abbreviated C_SAMP in the makefile. You will need a Java virtual
machine installed; see <a href="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</a>
if you need one.<br>
<br>
The default mechanism for creating list files is the one shown in the
makefile: the Java program <span style="font-family: monospace;">silk.util.RotamerSampler</span>.
Given the statistical and percentile data from the original rotamer
calculations (see <a href="../README.html">the README file</a> for a
refresher), it creates sample points a regular grid, provided they fall
inside the contour lines at a specified percentile level. For example,
it might sample leucine rotamers at five-degree intervals on a
chi1-chi2 grid, and keep only those that score at or above 10% on the
rotamer quality evaluation. It then writes out the statistical value as
"main" and the percentile value as "check", along with the chi angles.
"Main" is used in the second step to provide a figure of merit for each
conformation.<br>
